## Issue Title Conventions

Keep titles under 70 characters. Format:

| Type | Format | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| New feature | `[Feature] — [brief description]` | `Creative Domain Generator — LLM-powered domain ideas` |
| Bug fix | `fix: [what's broken]` | `fix: search results not loading after re-check` |
| Enhancement | `[Area]: [improvement]` | `Results page: add bulk export with filters` |
| Data migration | `migration: [what changes]` | `migration: add keyword_phrase index for volume lookups` |
| Refactor | `refactor: [what and why]` | `refactor: extract pipeline phases into separate hooks` |

## Label Recommendations

Apply labels that exist in the repository. Common useful labels:

- `enhancement` or `feature` — new functionality
- `bug` — something broken
- `refactor` — code improvement without behavior change
- `migration` — database changes
- `documentation` — docs only
