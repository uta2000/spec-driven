# Verify Acceptance Criteria

Mechanically checks all acceptance criteria from an implementation plan against the actual codebase. Delegates verification to the `task-verifier` agent and reports results.

**Announce at start:** "Running verify-acceptance-criteria to check implementation against the plan."

## When to Use

- After implementing one or more tasks from a plan
- Before claiming work is complete
- Before committing or creating a PR

## Process

### Step 0: Check for Existing PR

Before doing any work, check if a PR already exists for the current branch:

```bash
gh pr view --json url,state 2>/dev/null
```

**If a PR exists:** Announce "A PR already exists for this branch. Verification runs before PR creation in the standard workflow. Skipping." Exit gracefully — do not launch the task-verifier agent.

**If no PR exists:** Continue with Step 1.

### Step 1: Find the Plan File

Look for the plan file:
1. If the user specified a path, use it
2. Otherwise, find the most recently modified `.md` file in the plans directory:

```
Glob: docs/plans/*.md
```

If no `docs/plans/` directory exists, check for plan files in common locations:
- `plans/*.md`
- `docs/*.md` (look for files with "plan" or "implementation" in the name)

Pick the most recent file. Confirm with the user: "Verifying against plan: `[path]`. Is this correct?"

### Step 2: Extract Acceptance Criteria

Read the plan file and extract all `**Acceptance Criteria:**` sections.

For each task, collect:
- Task number and title
- All criteria items (lines starting with `- [ ]`)
- Note any `[MANUAL]` prefixed criteria (these will be flagged for human review)

If a specific task was requested, only extract criteria for that task.

### Step 3: Delegate to Task Verifier

Use the Task tool to launch the `task-verifier` agent with:

```
Verify the following acceptance criteria against the codebase.

Plan file: [path]
Task: [task number or "All tasks"]

Criteria to verify:

Task N: [Title]
- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2
...

Task M: [Title]
- [ ] Criterion 1
...

For criteria prefixed with [MANUAL], mark as CANNOT_VERIFY with reason "Requires manual testing".

Produce a verification report with a results table and verdict (VERIFIED / INCOMPLETE / BLOCKED).
```

### Step 4: Present Results

Display the verification report from the task-verifier agent to the user.

**If VERIFIED:**
```
All acceptance criteria verified. Implementation matches the plan.

[show report table]

You can proceed with committing / creating a PR.
```

**If INCOMPLETE:**
```
Some acceptance criteria failed. The following need attention:

[show report table, highlighting FAIL items]

Issues to fix:
1. [criterion] — [evidence of failure]
2. [criterion] — [evidence of failure]

Fix these issues and run verify-acceptance-criteria again.
```

**If BLOCKED:**
```
Verification could not be completed:
[reason — e.g., build broken, dependencies missing]

Resolve the blocker and run verify-acceptance-criteria again.
```

### Step 5: Update Plan (Optional)

If all criteria for a task pass, offer to check off the criteria in the plan:

```markdown
- [x] File exists at `src/components/Badge.tsx`  ← checked
- [x] `npm run typecheck` passes                 ← checked
- [ ] [MANUAL] Badge renders red on overlap       ← left unchecked (manual)
```

Only do this if the user agrees.
