# Design Document Section Templates

## Overview Template

```markdown
## Overview

[Feature name] is a [type: page/API/integration/workflow] that [what it does in one sentence].
[Why it exists or what problem it solves in one sentence]. [Key constraint or scope boundary in one sentence].
```

**Example:**
```markdown
## Overview

The Creative Domain Generator is a dedicated feature where users enter a city/region and an industry,
and an LLM generates ~100 creative, culturally-relevant domain name ideas. The user curates the list,
then selected domains go through the existing availability pipeline. Volume lookup is skipped —
creative domains are branding plays, not SEO plays.
```

## User Flow Template

```markdown
## User Flow

### Step 1 — [Verb phrase]
- [Input or action]
- [UI element description]
- [Constraints or validation]

### Step 2 — [Verb phrase]
- [What the user sees]
- [What they can do]
- [What happens next]

### Step 3 — [Verb phrase]
- [Output or result]
- [How it's displayed]
- [What actions are available]
```

Keep to 3-5 steps. If more are needed, the feature may be too complex for a single design.

## Data Model Changes Template

```markdown
## Data Model Changes

### `table_name` table
- Add `column_name` type (default: `value`) — [purpose]
- Make `column_name` nullable (currently NOT NULL — needs migration)
- Add constraint: [description]

### `other_table` table
- Add `column_name` type (nullable) — [purpose]
```

Rules:
- List every column change, including nullability changes
- Note the current state when it differs from the proposed state
- Include defaults for new columns
- Group by table

## Pipeline / Architecture Template

```markdown
## Pipeline Architecture

[Feature] uses a [new/modified] [pipeline/workflow/hook] because [reason for the approach].

**[Existing/Standard] flow:**
```
Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3
```

**[New/Modified] flow:**
```
Phase 1 → [New step] → Phase 2 → Phase 3
```

Key differences:
- [What changed and why]
- [What is reused from existing flow]
- [What is new]
```

## Migration Requirements Template

```markdown
## Migration Requirements

1. `table.column` — [add/alter/drop] [details]
2. `table.column` — [add/alter/drop] [details]
3. `TypeName` type — [what changes]
```

Rules:
- Number every item
- Use `table.column` format consistently
- Separate DB migrations from type/code changes
- Note when a migration affects existing data

## New Components Template

```markdown
## New Components

- **[Component name]** — [what it does] ([uses existing library X] or [new implementation])
- **[Hook name]** — [what it manages] ([X phases, reuses Y])
- **[Route]** — new route at `/path` with sidebar nav entry
```

## Scope Template

```markdown
## Scope

**Included:**
- [Feature boundary 1]
- [Feature boundary 2]

**Excluded:**
- [Explicitly out of scope item 1]
- [Explicitly out of scope item 2]

**Dependencies:**
- [No new API keys / dependencies needed]
- [Requires X to be set up first]
```
