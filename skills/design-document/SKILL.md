# Design Document

Turn brainstorming decisions into a structured, implementable design document. The document serves as the single source of truth between brainstorming and implementation planning.

**Announce at start:** "Writing design document to capture the agreed design before implementation."

## When to Use

- After brainstorming a feature (decisions have been made)
- When the user has a clear idea of what to build and needs it documented
- Before writing an implementation plan
- When translating requirements into technical design

## Process

### Step 1: Gather Context

Collect the inputs needed to write the document:

1. **From the conversation:** Extract all decisions made during brainstorming — scope, approach, UX flow, data model, technical choices
2. **From the codebase:** Explore existing patterns, tech stack, file structure, and conventions
3. **From Context7 documentation lookup:** If a documentation lookup step was run before this skill (as part of the `start-feature` lifecycle), use the patterns and recommendations it produced. These represent current best practices from official docs and should inform the technical approach in the design. If no lookup was run, check `.spec-driven.yml` for a `context7` field and query relevant libraries directly.

- Use Glob to find source files (e.g., `src/**/*.ts`, `src/**/*.tsx`)
- Use Grep to search for relevant patterns in the existing codebase
- Read existing design docs in `docs/plans/` for format reference

If the conversation does not contain enough decisions, ask the user to clarify. Use `AskUserQuestion` — one question at a time, with options when possible.

### Step 2: Determine Sections

Select sections based on what the feature requires. Not every feature needs every section.

**Required sections:**
- **Overview** — What the feature does, in 2-3 sentences
- **User Flow** — Step-by-step from the user's perspective
- **Scope** — What is included and what is explicitly excluded

**Include when applicable:**

| Section | Include When |
|---------|-------------|
| Example | The feature has input/output that benefits from a concrete example |
| Data Model Changes | The feature requires new or modified database tables/columns |
| Migration Requirements | Database migrations are needed (numbered list) |
| API / Integration | The feature calls external APIs or introduces new internal API routes |
| Pipeline / Architecture | The feature involves multi-step processing, async flows, or new hooks |
| LLM Integration | The feature uses an LLM (model, prompt design, output format, validation) |
| UI Adaptations | Existing UI components need modification for the new feature |
| New Components | New UI components, hooks, or utilities need to be built |

**Include when platform is mobile (ios, android, cross-platform):**

Check for `.spec-driven.yml` in the project root to determine the platform. If `platform` is `ios`, `android`, or `cross-platform`, add these sections:

| Section | Required | Purpose |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Feature Flag Strategy | Yes | How the feature can be killed server-side without an app update |
| Rollback Plan | Yes | Multi-version compatibility strategy since "revert deploy" doesn't work |
| API Versioning | If API changes | How old app versions interact with the new backend |
| Device Compatibility | Yes | Minimum OS versions, screen sizes, accessibility |

See `../../references/platforms/mobile.md` for section templates.

### Step 3: Write the Document

Write each section following these principles (see `references/section-templates.md` for templates):

- **Specific over vague:** Use actual table names, column types, file paths, and component names from the codebase
- **Decisions over options:** The design doc records what was decided, not what could be decided. If something is unresolved, flag it explicitly.
- **Minimal necessary detail:** Enough for an implementation plan to be written from it, but not implementation-level pseudocode
- **Cross-reference the codebase:** When referencing existing patterns, mention the actual files and functions

**Document format:**

```markdown
# [Feature Name] — Design Document

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Status:** Draft

## Overview
[2-3 sentences]

## Example
[Concrete input/output if applicable]

## User Flow
### Step 1 — [Name]
### Step 2 — [Name]
### Step 3 — [Name]

## [Technical sections as needed]

## Migration Requirements
[Numbered list of all schema/type changes]

## Scope
- [What's included]
- [What's explicitly excluded]
```

### Step 4: Save the Document

Write the document to the plans directory:

```
docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-[feature-name].md
```

Use today's date. Use kebab-case for the feature name.

If a design doc for this feature already exists (from a previous session), update it rather than creating a new file.

### Step 5: Present for Review

Present the document section by section (200-300 words per section). After each section, confirm with the user:

```
Does this section look right, or should I adjust anything?
```

If the document is short enough (under 1,000 words total), present it all at once.

### Step 6: Suggest Next Steps

After the document is approved:

```
Design document saved to `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-[feature-name].md`.

Recommended next steps:
1. Run `design-verification` to check this design against the codebase
2. Run `create-issue` to create a GitHub issue from this design
3. Run `writing-plans` to create an implementation plan with acceptance criteria
```

## Quality Rules

- **No orphan decisions:** Every decision from brainstorming must appear in the document. Review the conversation to confirm nothing was missed.
- **No unresolved ambiguity:** If something is unclear, ask the user rather than guessing. Flag explicitly unresolved items with `[TBD]`.
- **Match codebase terminology:** Use the same names for tables, columns, types, and components as they exist in the codebase.
- **Migration completeness:** Every proposed schema change must appear in the Migration Requirements section as a numbered item.
