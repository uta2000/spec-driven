# Design Verification

Verify a design document against the actual codebase to catch conflicts, gaps, and incorrect assumptions before implementation. This is the gate between "this sounds right" and "this will actually work."

**Announce at start:** "Running design-verification to check this design against the codebase for blockers and gaps."

## When to Use

- After writing or updating a design document
- Before creating a GitHub issue from a design
- Before writing an implementation plan
- When the user asks "will this work with our app?"

## Process

### Step 1: Load the Design Document

Find the design document:
1. If the user specified a path, use it
2. Otherwise, find the most recently modified `.md` file in `docs/plans/`:

```
Glob: docs/plans/*.md
```

Confirm with the user: "Verifying design: `[path]`. Is this correct?"

Read the full document and extract all proposed changes.

### Step 2: Load Project Context

Check for a `.spec-driven.yml` file in the project root:

1. If found, read the `platform`, `stack`, and `gotchas` fields
2. For each entry in `stack`, look for a matching reference file at `../../references/stacks/{name}.md` (relative to this skill's directory)
3. For the declared `platform`, load the platform reference from `../../references/platforms/{platform}.md` (use `mobile.md` for `ios`, `android`, or `cross-platform`)
4. If a stack has no matching reference file, note it and use `WebSearch` to research known gotchas for that technology

If `.spec-driven.yml` does not exist, proceed with the base checklist only. Mention to the user that project-specific context can be added via `.spec-driven.yml`.

See `../../references/project-context-schema.md` for the full schema documentation.

### Step 3: Explore the Codebase

Launch exploration agents to understand the areas of the codebase affected by the design. Use the Task tool with `subagent_type=Explore` for thorough analysis.

Key areas to explore:
- Database schema (migrations, ORM models, type definitions)
- TypeScript/language types and interfaces
- Existing pipeline/workflow hooks and API routes
- UI components that will be modified or reused
- Configuration files and environment variables

### Step 4: Run Verification Checklist

Execute each category from the verification checklist. For each item, record: PASS, FAIL, or WARNING.

**Read `references/checklist.md` for the full detailed checklist before proceeding with verification.** The base categories are:

1. **Schema Compatibility** — Nullability, constraints, FKs, column types
2. **Type Compatibility** — TypeScript/language types match proposed schema changes
3. **Pipeline / Flow Compatibility** — Existing hooks, API routes, data shapes
4. **UI Component Inventory** — Required components exist or are planned
5. **Cross-Feature Impact** — Changes to shared tables/types/components affect other features
6. **Completeness** — Error handling, loading states, edge cases
7. **Cost & Performance** — API costs, rate limits, payload sizes, N+1 queries
8. **Migration Safety** — Existing data, defaults, rollback
9. **Internal Consistency** — Design doc sections agree with each other
10. **Pattern Adherence** — Follows existing codebase conventions
11. **Dependency & API Contract Verification** — Library versions support proposed usage, external APIs behave as assumed
12. **Build Compatibility** — TypeScript strict mode, linting rules, framework config
13. **Route & Layout Chain** — New pages inherit auth, layout, providers correctly

**Then run additional checks from project context (if loaded in Step 2):**

14. **Stack-Specific Checks** — Run every check from the loaded stack reference files (e.g., Supabase PostgREST limits, Next.js server/client boundaries)
15. **Platform-Specific Checks** — Run checks from the platform reference file (e.g., mobile backward compatibility, feature flag requirements)
16. **Project Gotchas** — Check every entry in `.spec-driven.yml` `gotchas` against the design. Each gotcha is a mandatory verification item.

### Step 5: Report Findings

Present a structured report:

```
## Design Verification Report

**Design:** [path to design doc]
**Date:** [current date]

### Results

| # | Category | Status | Finding |
|---|----------|--------|---------|
| 1 | Schema Compatibility | FAIL | `keyword_phrase` is NOT NULL but design assumes nullable |
| 2 | Type Compatibility | FAIL | `SearchResult.service_id` is `string`, not `string \| null` |
| 3 | Pipeline Compatibility | WARNING | `useSearchPipeline` Phase 1 assumes service/location IDs |
| 4 | UI Components | PASS | All required components exist or are planned |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

### Blockers (FAIL — must fix before implementation)
1. [specific issue with exact file paths and line numbers]
2. [specific issue]

### Warnings (should address, not blocking)
1. [specific concern]

### Gaps (missing from design)
1. [what the design doesn't cover but should]

### Recommended Design Doc Updates
[Specific edits to make to the design document]
```

### Step 6: Apply Corrections

If the user approves, update the design document with corrections:
- Add missing migration requirements
- Fix incorrect assumptions about column types or nullability
- Add sections for gaps (e.g., missing error handling, missing UI adaptations)
- Update counts and references to be accurate

Confirm each change with the user before applying.

## Verification Depth

Adjust depth based on the design's scope:

| Design Scope | Depth |
|-------------|-------|
| New page with new data model | Full checklist (all 13 base categories + stack/platform/gotchas) |
| New API route, existing data model | Categories 1-3, 5, 7-8, 10-12 + stack/platform/gotchas |
| UI-only change, no schema changes | Categories 4-6, 9-10, 12-13 + platform/gotchas |
| Configuration or env change | Categories 7, 10-12 + stack/gotchas |

## Quality Rules

- **Evidence-based:** Every FAIL must include the exact file path, line number, and current value that conflicts with the design
- **Actionable:** Every finding must include a specific recommendation for how to fix it
- **No false alarms:** Only flag real conflicts. Do not flag theoretical concerns that are unlikely to occur.
- **Complete:** Check every proposed change in the design, not just the obvious ones
