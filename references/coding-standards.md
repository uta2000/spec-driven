# Coding Standards — Senior Engineer Principles

These standards are loaded during the implementation phase. Every piece of code written during a feature-flow lifecycle must follow these principles. Skills reference this file during the "Study Existing Patterns" step, implementation, and self-review.

## Core Principle

**Code should read like well-written prose.** A senior engineer reading your code for the first time should understand what it does, why it does it, and how it fits into the system — without needing comments to explain the obvious.

## Functions

- **Single responsibility:** Each function does one thing. If you need "and" to describe it, split it.
- **Max 30 lines:** If a function exceeds 30 lines, extract helper functions. Long functions are a sign of mixed responsibilities.
- **Meaningful names:** `fetchUserProfile()` not `getData()`. `calculateExpirationDate()` not `process()`. The name should make the function's purpose obvious.
- **Max 3 parameters:** More than 3 parameters suggests the function is doing too much or needs an options object.
- **Pure when possible:** Prefer functions that take inputs and return outputs over functions that mutate external state.
- **Early returns:** Use guard clauses to eliminate nesting. Return early for error cases.

```typescript
// BAD: deep nesting
function processUser(user) {
  if (user) {
    if (user.isActive) {
      if (user.hasPermission) {
        // actual logic buried 3 levels deep
      }
    }
  }
}

// GOOD: guard clauses
function processUser(user) {
  if (!user) return null
  if (!user.isActive) return null
  if (!user.hasPermission) throw new UnauthorizedError()
  // actual logic at top level
}
```

## Error Handling

- **Never swallow errors:** Empty catch blocks are bugs. Either handle the error, re-throw it, or log it with context.
- **Typed errors:** Use discriminated unions or custom error classes, not generic `Error` messages.
- **Error at the boundary:** Validate inputs at system boundaries (API routes, form handlers, external data). Trust internal code.
- **Fail fast:** If something is wrong, fail immediately with a clear error — don't let invalid state propagate.
- **User-facing errors are separate from system errors:** Users see friendly messages. Logs see stack traces and context.

```typescript
// BAD: swallowed error
try { await saveUser(data) } catch (e) { /* ignore */ }

// BAD: generic error
throw new Error('Something went wrong')

// GOOD: typed, contextual error handling
const { data, error } = await supabase.from('users').insert(userData)
if (error) {
  if (error.code === '23505') {
    return { error: 'A user with this email already exists' }
  }
  throw new DatabaseError('Failed to create user', { cause: error, userData })
}
```

## DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

- **Extract at 2 repetitions:** If you write the same logic twice, extract it into a shared function.
- **But don't over-abstract:** Three similar lines are better than a premature abstraction. The wrong abstraction is worse than duplication.
- **Shared utilities go in `lib/` or `utils/`:** Not scattered across components.
- **Constants, not magic values:** `const MAX_RETRY_COUNT = 3` not `3` scattered through code.

## Types (TypeScript)

- **No `any`:** Every `any` is a bug waiting to happen. Use `unknown` if you truly don't know the type, then narrow it.
- **Narrow types:** `status: 'active' | 'inactive'` not `status: string`. Let the type system catch invalid values.
- **Discriminated unions for variants:** Use a `type` or `kind` field to distinguish between different shapes.
- **Generated types for external data:** Database types from `supabase gen types`, API response types from schemas. Never hand-maintain types for external data.
- **Infer when obvious, annotate when not:** Don't annotate `const x: number = 5`. Do annotate function return types and complex objects.

```typescript
// BAD: loose types
interface SearchResult {
  status: string
  price: number | null
  data: any
}

// GOOD: tight types
interface SearchResult {
  status: 'available' | 'taken' | 'error'
  price: number | null
  data: DomainDetails
}
```

## Separation of Concerns

- **Data fetching separate from rendering:** Server components fetch, client components render. Don't mix.
- **Business logic separate from I/O:** Calculation functions shouldn't know about databases or APIs.
- **UI state separate from server state:** Use React Query / SWR for server state, useState for UI state. Don't mix.
- **Configuration separate from code:** API keys, URLs, thresholds go in environment variables or config objects, not inline.

## Structural Quality

- **No god objects:** A file, class, or component should have 2-3 responsibilities at most. If you need "and" more than twice to describe what it does, split it.
- **Dependency direction matters:** High-level modules (pages, orchestrators) depend on low-level modules (utilities, data access), never the reverse. Shared types live in a common layer.
- **No circular dependencies:** If module A imports from B, B must not import from A. Use dependency inversion (shared interface in a third module) to break cycles.
- **Explicit boundaries:** Features should be self-contained directories. Cross-feature imports go through public APIs (barrel exports), not deep file paths.
- **Colocation over centralization:** Put code where it's used. A utility used by one feature lives in that feature's directory, not in a global utils/ folder. Promote to shared only when a second consumer appears.

## Naming Conventions

- **Files:** Match the primary export. `UserProfile.tsx` exports `UserProfile`. `search-utils.ts` exports search utilities.
- **Components:** PascalCase. Descriptive. `SearchResultsTable` not `Table`.
- **Functions:** camelCase. Verb-first. `fetchResults()`, `calculateScore()`, `formatCurrency()`.
- **Constants:** SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE for true constants. `MAX_RESULTS_PER_PAGE`, `API_BASE_URL`.
- **Boolean variables:** Prefix with `is`, `has`, `should`, `can`. `isLoading` not `loading`. `hasPermission` not `permission`.
- **Event handlers:** Prefix with `handle`. `handleSubmit`, `handleClick`, `handleSearchComplete`.

## Code Organization

- **Imports at the top:** Organized by: external libraries, internal modules, relative imports, types.
- **Related code stays together:** Don't split related logic across distant parts of a file.
- **Export from index:** Use barrel exports (`index.ts`) for directories that export multiple related items.
- **Co-locate tests:** Test files next to the code they test, not in a separate tree.

## Comments

- **Code explains what and how. Comments explain why.**
- **Don't comment obvious code:** `// increment counter` above `counter++` is noise.
- **Do comment non-obvious decisions:** `// Using bulk endpoint (not single) because single-domain has 4s/req due to 429s`
- **TODO with context:** `// TODO(#42): Extract this when we add the second search type` — not just `// TODO: fix this`.

## Performance

- **Parallel when independent:** Use `Promise.all()` for independent async operations, not sequential `await`.
- **Paginate large datasets:** Never load unbounded data. Always use `.range()` or equivalent.
- **Debounce user input:** Search boxes, form validation, resize handlers.
- **Memoize expensive computations:** Use `useMemo` for expensive calculations, `useCallback` for stable function references.
- **Don't optimize prematurely:** Write clear code first. Profile before optimizing. Readable > fast unless you have evidence.

## Testing

- **Test behavior, not implementation:** Test what the function does, not how it does it.
- **One assertion per concept:** Each test should verify one thing. Multiple assertions are OK if they all verify the same concept.
- **Descriptive test names:** `it('returns null when user is not found')` not `it('test1')`.
- **AAA pattern:** Arrange (set up), Act (execute), Assert (verify). Keep them visually separated.
- **Test edge cases:** Empty arrays, null inputs, boundary values, error paths. Not just the happy path.

## Stack-Specific Standards

These are loaded from Context7 and the stack reference files. When implementing, query Context7 for the current recommended patterns for your stack.

### Next.js (App Router)
- Prefer Server Components. Only add `'use client'` when hooks or browser APIs are needed.
- Server Actions for mutations. Route Handlers for external API proxying.
- `revalidatePath()` after mutations. Don't forget cache invalidation.
- Zod validation on every server-side input boundary.

### Supabase
- Always use `@supabase/ssr` for server-side, `@supabase/supabase-js` for client-side.
- Use generated types. Never hand-type database row shapes.
- Every query that could return >1 row: use `.range()` pagination.
- RLS on every table. No exceptions.

### React / React Native
- Custom hooks for reusable stateful logic. Not utility functions with `useState` inside components.
- Props interface exported alongside component.
- Loading/error/empty states for every async operation.
- Avoid prop drilling > 2 levels. Use context or composition instead.

## Tool Usage Patterns

- **Check file size before `Read` on unfamiliar files:** `wc -c <file>`. Files >200KB will exceed the 256KB tool limit.
- **Large files (>200KB):** Use Grep to find relevant sections, or Read with offset/limit targeting specific functions.
- **Code review:** `git diff` contains only the changed sections — prefer it over reading full files for reviewing changes.
- **Never read generated files whole:** Build artifacts, minified bundles, lock files, and generated types can be megabytes. Always use targeted reads.

## How This File Is Used

1. **Study Existing Patterns step:** Claude reads this file AND existing codebase patterns before writing code
2. **Implementation:** These standards guide every line of code written
3. **Self-review:** After implementation, code is reviewed against these standards before formal code review
4. **Anti-pattern hook:** PostToolUse hook checks for violations of these standards
